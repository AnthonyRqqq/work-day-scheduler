# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

![Screenshot of the scheduler](./Assets/screenshot.jpg)

This is a basic planner for organizing a work day.
<br>I was provided with a basic structure for an hour block.
<br>This included sizing and color coordinating as well as other styling.
<br>Both QueryJS and DayJS were used to add functionality to the page.
<br>Blocks of hours will change color depending on whether they are past, present, or future.
<br>In addition, appointments can be saved to localStorage in the text boxes.
<br>When clicking the save icon, a confirmation message will appear and the saved items will load when the page is next opened.
